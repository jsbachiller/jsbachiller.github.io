## Job Market Paper


**The academic cost of international conflict**

[Draft available upon request]

Abstract: Countries involved in international armed conflicts pay a high price
in terms of human capital. By leveraging the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war 
in 2022, I analyse the cost that Russia-based researchers had to pay in academic terms.
I find that the start of the conflict brought along a 
penalty to academics based in Russia, , who see their citations drop in a magnitude
similar to the penalties found following paper retractions. I also find that they
struggle to publish their research in international journals, even if they maintain 
similar productivity levels as in the pre-war period. Emigration seems to alleviate 
the problem, although with some delay.

Abstract: An extensive literature has documented the incentive effect of emigration 
prospects in terms of human capital accumulation at origin. Less attention has been
paid to the impact on specific educational choices. Using novel data from graduates
from the University of Lorraine (France) we find that students who paid attention to
the foreign labor market at the time of enrollment tend to choose topics that lead 
to highly-valued occupations in Luxembourg, a booming economy across the border. 
These results hold when accounting for heterogeneous substitution patterns and for 
the potential endogeneity of the interest for the foreign labor market.
