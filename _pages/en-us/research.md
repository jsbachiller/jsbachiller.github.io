## Job Market Paper


**The academic cost of international conflict**

[Draft available upon request]

Abstract: Countries involved in international armed conflicts pay a high price
in terms of human capital. By leveraging the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war 
in 2022, I analyse the cost that Russia-based researchers had to pay in academic terms.
I find that the start of the conflict brought along a 
penalty to academics based in Russia, , who see their citations drop in a magnitude
similar to the penalties found following paper retractions. I also find that they
struggle to publish their research in international journals, even if they maintain 
similar productivity levels as in the pre-war period. Emigration seems to alleviate 
the problem, although with some delay.

- **Emigration prospects and educational choices: Evidence from the Lorraine-Luxembourg corridor**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Michel Beine and Vincent Fromentin
<small>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Submitted* [[Latest version](/assets/pdf/EduLorraine.pdf)]  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract: An extensive literature
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has documented the incentive effect 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of emigration prospects in terms of 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human capital accumulation at origin. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less attention has been paid to the impact 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on specific educational choices. Using novel 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data from graduates from the University of 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorraine (France) we find that students who paid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attention to the foreign labor market at the time 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of enrollment tend to choose topics that lead to 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highly-valued occupations in Luxembourg, a booming 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economy across the border. These results hold when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accounting for heterogeneous substitution patterns 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the potential endogeneity of the interest 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the foreign labor market.
