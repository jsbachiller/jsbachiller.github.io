Abstract: An extensive literature has documented the incentive effect of emigration 
prospects in terms of human capital accumulation at origin. Less attention has been
paid to the impact on specific educational choices. Using novel data from graduates
from the University of Lorraine (France) we find that students who paid attention to
the foreign labor market at the time of enrollment tend to choose topics that lead 
to highly-valued occupations in Luxembourg, a booming economy across the border. 
These results hold when accounting for heterogeneous substitution patterns and for 
the potential endogeneity of the interest for the foreign labor market.
