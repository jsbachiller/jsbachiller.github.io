**Emigration prospects and educational choices: Evidence from the Lorraine-Luxembourg corridor** 
with [Michel Beine](https://sites.google.com/site/michelbeineeconomics/home) and [Vincent Fromentin](https://sites.google.com/site/vfromentin/home)
<small>[[Latest version](/assets/pdf/EduLorraine.pdf)]  
An extensive literature has documented the incentive effect of emigration prospects in
terms of human capital accumulation in origin countries. Much less attention has been
paid to the impact on specific educational choices. We provide some evidence from the
enrolment behavior of students at the University of Lorraine that is located in the
northeast of France and close to Luxembourg, a booming economy with attractive work
conditions. We find that students who paid attention to the foreign labor market at
the time of enrollment tend to choose topics that lead to occupations that are highly
valued in Luxembourg. These results hold when accounting for heterogeneous substitution
patterns across study fields through the estimation of advanced discrete choice models.
Incentive effects of emigration prospects are also found when accounting for the potential
endogeneity of the interest for the foreign labor market using a control function approach
based on the initial locations of these students at the time of enrollment. Consistently,
students showing no attention to the foreign labor market are not subject to the incentive
effect of emigration prospects.
